# MelanomaNoMore

In a world where many of us enjoy spending time in the sun, we are at a higher risk for melanoma skin cancer. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are diagnosed with invasive melanoma each year. This project attempts to develop a model that can effectively recognize benign (not cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) melanoma. In this project, we utilized the convolutional neural network machine learning model in order to find an optimal model for detecting cancerous melanoma.
